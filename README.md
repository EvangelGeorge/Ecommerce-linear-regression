## Project Overview
In this project, we analyze customer data for an e-commerce business to understand the relationship between various factors such as session length, time spent on the app and website, length of membership, and yearly amount spent by customers. The project includes:

Data loading and preprocessing using the pandas library.
Data visualization and exploration using matplotlib and seaborn.
Linear regression modeling using scikit-learn.
Model evaluation and interpretation of coefficients.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Results
The analysis provides insights into customer behavior and its impact on yearly spending. Key findings include:

- The length of membership has a strong positive correlation with yearly spending.
- Time spent on the app has a positive impact on yearly spending.
- Time spent on the website has a weak negative correlation with yearly spending.
- The linear regression model predicts yearly spending based on the provided features, with high accuracy and low error metrics.
